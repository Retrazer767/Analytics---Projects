# Analytics Projects

## Description

This repository contains the  projects where I took data sets from Kaggle 

- I aimed to learn about ML and try solving various problems within it
- These projects helped me to gain knowledge in Machine Learning and data analysis

## ML Projects


## Fraudulent Credit card Analysis
  Took the credit card transaction data from Kaggle to develop a Machine Learning model to predict the transaction as fraud and non-fraud transactions. 
  As the data set is highly imbalanced, employed a technique of random under-sampling.
  Used ML algorithms such as Logistic regression and Support Vector Classifier to develop a model.

## Spam mail Prediction using Naive Bayes Classifier
  Utilized Kaggle's email dataset to implement Natural Language Processing techniques, 
  Removed stop words, applied stemming, and converted the data into vectors using Bag-of-Words.
  Enhanced the features using TFIDF and employed the Naive Bayes algorithm for spam and ham classification.

## House Price prediction using advanced regression techniques:
  Took the data on housing prices from Kaggle with various features.
  Did feature engineering to find the important features
  Applied advanced regression algorithms to it to predict the housing price.
  Found the cost function of each model and compared them to find a generalized model.

## Power BI Projects

# Choclate Industry Supply chain Data analysis using Power BI

## Description

- Did a project using a sample chocolate industry data and using power BI I created a dashboard to analyse their supply chain
- Used Power query to clean up and transform the data for my use case
- Used the inbuilt DAX scripting and developed a Dashboard
